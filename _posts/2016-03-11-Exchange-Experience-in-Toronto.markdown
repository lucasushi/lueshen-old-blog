Generally speaking, the exchange semester is an extraordinarily wonderful journey during my university life. There are so many exciting events to share that I cannot even select a particular one to start with. 

## Jet Lag
The jet lag and time difference between parents, friends and me initiated the journey. I was often disturbed by cellphone vibrations in deep night at the very beginning. However, as time went on, we gradually got used to this strange but interesting phenomenon. Actually, I even attended some interviews held by CityU for OIS and CIS later in the semester.

## Travel
Traveling around in a foreign country is another challenging but enjoyable journey. Within these short four months, I visited several places in North America, namely, Toronto, Niagara Falls, Montreal, Ottawa and Chicago. Cycling along the Niagara River, hiking the Mount Royal, and watching NBA games at the stadium gave me great comforts and relaxations. The most common feeling is that Canadian cities are much more tranquil than Hong Kong, less populated, less crowded, and you can even be offered with serenity when living in downtown! 


## Old Friend
To meet an old friend in a distant land is like refreshing rain after a long drought. The happiest period during exchange is to visit a high school classmate in Chicago. She showed me around and we had a wonderful memory with each other. In year 2 SemB, my roommate was a friendly Canadian guy from Montreal. After final exams in the exchange sem, I went to visit him and he treated me as how I treated him in Hong Kong. More coincidently, my current roommate is another Canadian guy from Toronto! To conclude, what a tiny world!


## Day Day Up
There is one thing I want to strengthen at the end. The work load in US and Canadian universities is much heavier than in Hong Kong. We only have one day off for the Thanksgiving day, and another one for the fall break. For the most of time, I needed to stay up to deep night to comprehend what I learned today. Therefore, life for outbound exchange is not that easy as said.
